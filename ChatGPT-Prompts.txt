Prompt: Explain to me Encapsulation in C#


ChatGPT Response:
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is supported in C#. 
It refers to the bundling of data (attributes or fields) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.
 The internal details of the class, such as the implementation of methods and the representation of data,
  are hidden from the outside world. Only a class's public interface, which consists of its public methods and properties, is accessible to the external code.

Here are key aspects of encapsulation in C#:

    Access Modifiers:
    C# provides access modifiers to control the visibility of class members. The common access
     modifiers include public, private, protected, and internal. These modifiers 
     determine whether a class member can be accessed from outside the class.
        public: Accessible from any other class.
        private: Accessible only within the same class.
        protected: Accessible within the same class and its derived classes.
        internal: Accessible within the same assembly.

    Properties and Methods:
    Encapsulation involves exposing the internal state of an object through properties and methods. 
    Properties allow controlled access to the internal fields of a class, and methods define the
     operations that can be performed on the object's data.
     public class MyClass
{
    // Private field encapsulated using a property
    private int myField;

    public int MyProperty
    {
        get { return myField; }
        set { myField = value; }
    }

    // Public method encapsulating functionality
    public void PerformAction()
    {
        // Perform some action
    }
}
Getters and Setters:
In C#, properties are often used to encapsulate fields. The get accessor provides read access,
 and the set accessor provides write access. This allows for controlled access to the internal 
 state of the object.

Information Hiding:
Encapsulation helps with information hiding. By exposing only a limited and well-defined 
interface to the external world, the internal implementation details of the class can be changed
 without affecting the code that uses the class.
 public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance;

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        // Some complex logic to calculate balance
        return balance;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        // Validate and update balance
        balance += amount;
    }
}
    In this example, the actual representation of the balance is hidden, and clients interact with the 
    account using the GetBalance and Deposit methods.

Encapsulation contributes to building modular, maintainable, and scalable code by providing a 
clear separation between the internal workings of a class and its external interactions. It also helps
 prevent unintended interference or modification of the internal state by external code.
